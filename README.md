# Patitas 🐾

### The Responsible Adoption Platform

Welcome to **Patitas**, a modern web platform designed to connect animals looking for a home with responsible and committed adopters.  
The main goal of Patitas is to provide a safe, organized, and accessible space where shelters, rescue organizations, and verified individuals can publish animals for adoption while users can easily browse, filter, and find their ideal companion.

---

## 🚀 About the Project

Patitas was created as a complete web solution that addresses the growing need for ethical and transparent adoption processes.  
Instead of relying on scattered posts across social media, Patitas centralizes adoption information and presents it in a clean, trustworthy, and user-friendly way.

The platform focuses on:

- Simplifying the adoption experience.
- Ensuring all published animals come from legitimate and responsible sources.
- Helping users make better adoption decisions with clear and accurate information.
- Promoting responsible pet ownership through education and resources.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- **Adoption Gallery:** Browse all available animals published by verified shelters or users.
- **Advanced Filtering:** Search by species, size, age, health status, behavior, and location.
- **Pet Profiles:** Each animal has its own page including photos, description, personality, weight, breed, and adoption requirements.
- **Account System:** Users and shelters can register to publish or manage their pets.
- **Location-Based Search:** Filter animals by proximity to adopters’ zones.
- **Secure Contact Flow:** Communicate safely and transparently with the shelter or responsible user.
- **Responsive Design:** Fully optimized for mobile and desktop use.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Next.js** – React framework for optimized performance and SEO.
- **TypeScript** – Type-safe development for scalability and reliability.
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first styling for a clean and modern interface.
- **Supabase (PostgreSQL)** – Database and authentication for structured data management.
- **Shadcn/UI** – Component library for consistent design (optional).
